# General

For a definition of what an `actor` can represent in the system, please refer to the Foundry VTT website: [Actors](https://foundryvtt.com/article/actors/)

# Types

Currently, the system supports the following types of `actors`:

## Character

The main type of `actor` supported by the system is the `character`. It is used to represent an important part of the game entities :

 - Playing characters (PC) used by players,
 - Distinct non-playing characters (NPC) used by the gamemaster

## Grunt

The second type of `actor` supported by the system is the `grunt`. Although close to the `character` type, it has a few differences as it is meant to be used by the gamemaster to handle non-distinct non-playing characters in a game.

# Development notes

More `actor` types will be supported by the system in a later phase of development (drones, vehicles, sprites...), once the stability of the current `actors` models have been firmly established.
